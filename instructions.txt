Implementation of Tiger Game in Python 2.7 / 3.4+
--------------------------------------

Requirements
--------------------------------------
Open a command prompt / terminal and execute : pip install joblib

Joblib is a multiprocessing library required by this game engine to execute
millions of runs in parallel on your machine.

Steps
--------------------------------------
Overwrite the code in agent.py (the act method).

Observations can be checked by self.observations and actions can be
taken using self.actions as shown in the example code (which uses
Leslie Kaelbling's optimal Finite State Machine model for the Tiger game)

To run the code, open a terminal / command line at this location and type 'python tigergame.py'.
If you wish to use arguments as well, 'python tigergame.py -v -t 1e5 ...'

Parameters
--------------------------------------

There are various parameters which can be modified to alter the game behaviour,
however it is recommended to keep all parameters unchanged to conform to the original paper.

-t    :   Number of iterations  (default 10000)
-r    :   Default reward value  (default 10.0)
-a    :   Listening accuracy    (default 0.85)
-tp   :   Tiger penalty valye   (default -100)
-lp   :   Listening penalty     (default -1)
-seed :   Random seed value     (default -1, which means no random seed)
-v    :   Verbosity of the game (there is no default, add -v during execution to enable print statements)
